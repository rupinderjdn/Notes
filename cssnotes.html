UNITS IN CSS 
1) Absolute (Non-Scalable means not responsive) -> pixel
2) Relative -> rem, em, vh,ven , %
            -> scalable and responsive 
    rem-> relative to html element means webpage(16px fontsize is default these days)
    example :-1 rem=1 X 16pixel=16 pixel

    em-> relative to element itself, suppose the fontsize on the element is 
    not default then it will go to it's parent

CSS DISPLAY PROPERTIES
- our browser gives a default display property to every element
- there are basic three types block, inline ,inline-block
- block-> h1,h2,p,div
- inline-> span,a, img,
- block-> takes the full space of the particular line in both right and left
       -> even if we don't give any content in our div tag it will still acquire 
        all the space 
        -> block element apply a line break after them
        -> height and width are significant
- inline-> takes only the required space
        -> no line breaks
        -> height and width have no significance 
- inline block-> will take only the required space
            -> height and width can be manipulated
