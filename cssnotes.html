Selecors in CSS  
1) simple selectors -> name -> div,form,input,p,a 
                    -> id
                    -> class
2) combinator selector -> space " "
                       -> > immediate
                       -> + immediate Sibling 
                       -> ~ general Sibling
3) Attribute Selector -> type, class, id, name , value, href 
you can find selector notes in +notes.html file


UNITS IN CSS 
1) Absolute (Non-Scalable means not responsive) -> pixel
2) Relative -> rem, em, vh,ven , %
            -> scalable and responsive 
    rem-> relative to html element means webpage(16px fontsize is default these days)
    example :-1 rem=1 X 16pixel=16 pixel

    em-> relative to element itself, suppose the fontsize on the element is 
    not default then it will go to it's parent 
    example:- 1 X 10=10pixel
    suppose no parent then it will also goto HTMl page.

    vh-> relative to viewport height
    example :- 10vh= 10% of viewport height

    vw-> relative to viewport width
    example:- 10vw=10% of viewport width

    %-> relative to it's parent

BOX MODEL OF CSS 
- Rendering engine of browser converts every html tag to a rectangular box.
- Every rectangular box is divided into four parts:- margin, border, padding, content
for notes box model css


CSS DISPLAY PROPERTIES
- our browser gives a default display property to every element
- there are basic three types block, inline ,inline-block
- block-> h1,h2,p,div
- inline-> span,a, img,
- block-> takes the full space of the particular line in both right and left
       -> even if we don't give any content in our div tag it will still acquire 
        all the space 
        -> block element apply a line break after them
        -> height and width are significant
- inline-> takes only the required space
        -> no line breaks
        -> height and width have no significance 
- inline block-> will take only the required space
            -> height and width can be manipulated


CSS POSITIONING PROPERTIES
- if we want to float our elements on the webpage then we need to know about positioning
- in some webpages the headbar stays there while we scroll down or up
- also the chat proctor on some sites remain their constantly
- Positions -> Static
                - all tags on our html page is by default static means they stay 
                in one poistion

            -> Relative
               - it is almost static, it is relative to page with top,left,right,bottom(TLBR)
               - element will be positioned 
               - but it's natuaral flow remains

            -> Absolute
              - TLBR has effect
              - element will be positioned
              - natural flow will be maintianed
              - scroll has effect

            -> fixed
              - TLBR has effect
              - element will be positioned
              - natural flow will be maintianed
              - example:- chat box
              - no effect of scroll

            -> Sticky 
              - Hybrid of relative and fixed
              - element is positioned
              - TLBR effect is three
              - remains in natural flow
              - no effect of scroll
              - parent of the sticky element will be sticky container
              - and sticky element will only work inside the container
              - never get out of container
              
FLEX BOX
- use to provide space distribution 
- provides freedom to the programmer of arranging boxes and stuff automatically
- default orientation of a flex box is horitzontal
- we must add display:flex; in the .csss file inorder to make flex work;

  Properties -> Flex Container
                -> flex-directions-> row
                                   -> column
                                   -> row-reverse
                                   -> columns-reverse
                -> Alignment and justification 
                                   -> justify content -> main axis
                                                      -> space between and around items

                                   -> align items -> cross axis
                                   -> align content -> cross axis
                                                    -> space between and around items

                -> Flex Items -> flex-grow
                              -> flex-shrink
CSS DEFAULT STYLING
          -> Box Sizing -> Content Box -> width of element = width of content
            (After adding border and padding)-> height of element =height of content


                        -> Border Box -> width of element = width + border
    (After adding border and padding)-> height of element = height +padding           

CSS MEDIA QUERIES
 -> Use for responsive designs
 -> for the change in viewport
 -> Syntax:- @media media_type  and(operator) (min-width) and (max-width)
              media_type-> screen, print, all

DOM(Document Object Module)
DOM IN-DEPTH QUESTION TASK1
  -> add event listeners-> identifies the events on the webpage like click and all
                        -> keyboard events
                        -> scrolling
                        -> async data flow
  -> queryselector() -> refference node
  -> inner text="_____"
  -> create element -> creates a HTML element like div,span,a,img
  -> appendchild() -> appending a child in div

DOM IN-DEPTH QUESTION TASK2
 -> queryselector() -> selects a refference to the element
 -> queryselectorall() -> returns a nodelist with array representation
                          -> it has 0 based indexing
                          -> we can access the refferences using a loop
                          -> length property will return length of the nodelist
                          -> it is just a representation not an array, so functionalities of array will not work
                       -> HTML collection is also similar to nodelist, it is also a 
                          representation to array and functionalities of array will not work
 -> insertBefore() -> insert before a particular element inside a parent
                   Syntax:- Parent.insertBefore(100,3)

DOM IN-DEPTH QUESTION TASK 3
 # getAttribute-> return the value inside the class
 # setAttribute-> sets the value inside the class
 # classList -> return a Dom token list -> space separated values of class 
             -> add
             -> remove
             -> contains

CSS Grids
- flexbox is for one-dimensional layouts and css grids are for 2-dimensional layouts
