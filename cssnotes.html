UNITS IN CSS 
1) Absolute (Non-Scalable means not responsive) -> pixel
2) Relative -> rem, em, vh,ven , %
            -> scalable and responsive 
    rem-> relative to html element means webpage(16px fontsize is default these days)
    example :-1 rem=1 X 16pixel=16 pixel

    em-> relative to element itself, suppose the fontsize on the element is 
    not default then it will go to it's parent 
    example:- 1 X 10=10pixel
    suppose no parent then it will also goto HTMl page.

    vh-> relative to viewport height
    example :- 10vh= 10% of viewport height

    vw-> relative to viewport width
    example:- 10vw=10% of viewport width

    %-> relative to it's parent

CSS DISPLAY PROPERTIES
- our browser gives a default display property to every element
- there are basic three types block, inline ,inline-block
- block-> h1,h2,p,div
- inline-> span,a, img,
- block-> takes the full space of the particular line in both right and left
       -> even if we don't give any content in our div tag it will still acquire 
        all the space 
        -> block element apply a line break after them
        -> height and width are significant
- inline-> takes only the required space
        -> no line breaks
        -> height and width have no significance 
- inline block-> will take only the required space
            -> height and width can be manipulated


CSS POSITIONING PROPERTIES
- if we want to float our elements on the webpage then we need to know about positioning
- in some webpages the headbar stays there while we scroll down or up
- also the chat proctor on some sites remain their constantly
- Positions -> Static
                - all tags on our html page is by default static means they stay 
                in one poistion

            -> Relative
               - it is almost static, it is relative to page with top,left,right,bottom(TLBR)
               - element will be positioned 
               - but it's natuaral flow remains

            -> Absolute
              - TLBR has effect
              - element will be positioned
              - natural flow will be maintianed
              - scroll has effect

            -> fixed
              - TLBR has effect
              - element will be positioned
              - natural flow will be maintianed
              - example:- chat box
              - no effect of scroll

            -> Sticky 
              - Hybrid of relative and fixed
              - element is positioned
              - TLBR effect is three
              - remains in natural flow
              - no effect of scroll
              - parent of the sticky element will be sticky container
              - and sticky element will only work inside the container
              - never get out of container
